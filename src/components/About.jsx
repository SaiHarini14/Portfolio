        <p>
          Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="about-highlight">Sai Harini G</span> ðŸ‘‹ â€” a final-year MCA student and aspiring <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>.
          I enjoy creating applications that are not only functional but also meaningful, with the aim of making a positive difference in how people interact with technology.
          <p>I love exploring new ideas, learning different tools, and improving step by step. For me, building projects is about solving problems in a way that feels simple and useful. I like working on both the creative side of design and the logical side of development, which keeps things exciting and balanced.
</p><p>Beyond academics and coding, Iâ€™m someone who enjoys reading books and listening to music â€” they give me fresh perspectives, help me relax, and often inspire my creativity.
